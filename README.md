About website structure: I used html, css, javascript and php to create my website and connect it with the database over a server.

About database: I used xampp server to connect my database with my website. I created my database in xampp server in PhpMyAdmin. There is one table which is created for getting details from the contact us form. There are name, email, message. When you fill the the form, the database will collect those details to the table name call “validationform”. 

This is a localhost server, and it can’t execute online , neet to install the server in your device and then with the localhost url you can visit the website and check the database as well as. To do this task first please download the zip file from the github repository and save it in your device in the server folder in your C folder.
